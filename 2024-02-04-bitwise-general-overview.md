# Bitwise Operators - Overview

## Overview

Numbers can be represented in different ways, some of the most common representations include binary or decimal numbering systems.

Below table summarizes a few fundamental distinctions between binary and decimal numbering systems:

| Aspect                   | Binary System                                      | Decimal System                                      |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Base**                 | Base-2 numbering system (0 and 1)                 | Base-10 number system (0 through 9)                |
| **Digits**               | Uses only 0 and 1                                  | Uses digits 0 through 9                            |
| **Place Value**          | Each digit's place value represents a power of 2  | Each digit's place value represents a power of 10 |
| **Usage in Computers**   | Used internally in computers                      | Used by humans for everyday calculations           |
| **Compactness**          | Binary representations are typically longer       | Decimal representations can be more concise        |
| **Ease of Comprehension**| Challenging for humans due to longer representations| More natural and intuitive for human comprehension|
| **Mathematical Operations** | Simpler rules, especially in addition and multiplication | Aligns closely with everyday human calculations   |

## Binary Numbers in Computing: Enhancing Efficiency and Reliability

Binary numbers play a important role in computing systems, contributing to enhanced efficiency and reliability across various aspects of digital operations.

### Digital Compatibility:

Binary numbers seamlessly align with the on/off states of digital components, notably transistors. Transistors, integral to digital circuits, operate using binary states, signifying 0 (off) and 1 (on).

### Simplified Circuit Design:

Binary's inherent simplicity, with just two digits (0 and 1), facilitates the streamlined design of electronic circuits. Logical operations within electronic circuits benefit from the straightforward nature of binary.

### Efficient Arithmetic:

Binary arithmetic, characterized by its simplicity, contributes to efficient mathematical operations in digital systems. Binary addition and subtraction operations are more straightforward compared to their decimal counterparts.

### Storage Optimization:

Binary's efficient representation allows for optimized information storage within digital systems. Binary-coded data optimizes memory usage, a critical factor in storing vast amounts of information in computers.

### Reliable Error Detection:

The structure of binary supports robust error detection mechanisms, enhancing reliability in data transmission. Parity checking, a binary-based technique, ensures dependable error detection in communication protocols.

### Historical Significance:

Binary's early adoption in computer design has solidified its status as a standard in modern computing. Pioneering computers, such as the ENIAC, were built on binary principles, influencing subsequent computer architectures.

## Bitwise Operators: Manipulating Binary Numbers


Bit manipulation involves manipulating individual bits in a binary representation of data. It's a powerful and efficient technique often used in programming for tasks such as optimizing algorithms, working with hardware, and performing various bitwise operations.

Let's delve into some fundamental bitwise operations and concepts:

**Bitwise AND**: The bitwise AND operator compares each bit of two numbers. If both bits are 1, the resulting bit is 1; otherwise, it's 0.  (a & b)
```bash
(a & b)
```

**Bitwise OR**: The bitwise OR operator compares each bit of two numbers. If at least one bit is 1, the resulting bit is 1; otherwise, it's 0.  
```bash
(a | b)
```

**Bitwise XOR**: The bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator compares each bit of two numbers. If the bits are different, the resulting bit is 1; if they are the same, it's 0.
```bash
(a ^ b)
```

**Bitwise NOT**: The bitwise NOT operator inverts each bit of a number. It turns 1s into 0s and 0s into 1s.
```bash
(~a)
```

**Left Shift**: The left shift operator shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions, adding 0s on the right.
```bash
(a << n)
```

**Right Shift**: The right shift operator shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions, adding 0s on the left for unsigned integers. For signed integers, the sign bit is used to fill the left. 
```bash
(a >> n)
```

**Setting a Bit**: To set a specific bit to 1, use the bitwise OR operator with a number containing only the bit you want to set. 
```bash
(a = a or (1 << n))
```

**Clearing a Bit**: To clear a specific bit to 0, use the bitwise AND operator with a number containing all bits set to 1 except the bit you want to clear. 
```bash
(a = a & ~(1 << n))
```

**Toggling a Bit**: To toggle a specific bit (change 1 to 0 and vice versa), use the bitwise XOR operator with a number containing only the bit you want to toggle.
```bash
(a = a ^ (1 << n))
```
